h2. Devoxx France 2012

The Devoxx France 2012 demo for Elasticsearch is available on Github : "https://github.com/dadoonet/devoxxfr_demo":https://github.com/dadoonet/devoxxfr_demo
Feel free to fork it and make the code more fancy (my jQuery knowledge is basic) ;-)

Demo is also live here : "http://www.devoxx.pilato.fr/":http://www.devoxx.pilato.fr/


h2. Other Curl demos

To launch demos, you have to download and unzip elasticsearch-0.18.7.
If you want to use another version, you will have to modify utils/installPlugins.sh, utils/startNode.sh and utils/startNodeConf.sh

Modify the following line :

	ES_VERSION="0.18.7"
